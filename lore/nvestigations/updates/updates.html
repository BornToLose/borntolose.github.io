					Someone apparently managed to access the server. I'm not sure I understand exactly, but there have supposedly been attempts to log into those digitized archives, some of them successful. Also supposedly, it <i>should</i> have been possible to trace these attempts back to where they came from, but the server was somehow unable to identify their source.<br>
					I'm having trouble grasping the specifics; I have almost never used any kind of computer. I got help from a Nincada who offered to handle the more technical side of this project. This is what she's telling me is happening though... and it's worrisome.

					The initial upload process is taking longer than expected. By the time my notes are properly archived, they might already be outdated.<br>
					When the Host reached Driftveil, I found out <b><i>he</i></b> had went there to meet them. I don't think he trusts me, even though he knows I wouldn't dare risk to put my friends in danger by defying him. I have to be very careful about which notes I choose to share with him.

					The archive has been set up, and I started digitizing my notes. The server is slow so uploading could take a while. But at least it is secure. I need a backup in case something happens to the physical copy, but these archives must not fall into the wrong hands.
