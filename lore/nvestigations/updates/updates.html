					The initial upload process is taking longer than expected. By the time my notes are properly archived, they might already be outdated.<br>
					When the Host reached Driftveil, I found out <b><i>he</i></b> had went there to meet them. I don't think he trusts me, even though he knows I wouldn't dare risk to put my friends in danger by defying him. I have to be very careful about which notes I choose to share with him.

					I have set up the archive and started digitizing my notes. The server is slow so uploading could take a while. But at least it is secure. I need a backup in case something happens to the physical copy, but this archive must not fall into the wrong hands.
