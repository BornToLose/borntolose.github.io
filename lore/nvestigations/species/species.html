						Over time, their aroma has mutated into a light-bending veil that makes them virtually impervious to harm. The more of them gather, the more their veils fill with glowing colors and flaring sparks. Sadly, their taste is so delicious that the vast majority of their predators have completely adapted to it, and their regenerative abilities prove useless as they always get devoured to the very last crumb.

						The highly alcoholic substance that makes up its body confers it with a disproportionate amount of strength. It likes to draw attention by pretending to be hurt, but the smell of its tears is so strong that it'll make anyone pass out; this earned it the nickname of "curse-flavored cream", even though it means no harm. It is customary to adorn it with a paper umbrella to make it more recognizable.

						This incarnation of the Claw Fossil is the highest-ranking divinity of its Pantheon. According to myths, it is a patron of silent nights, who wields a blade made of lightning and a whip made of wood to strike down the nightmares and creatures that lurk in the dark until morning. Children are often taught not to fear stormy nights, as they are a sign that it is standing guard to protect them in their sleep.

						This minor deity is associated with survivalism; his body has adapted into a fertile ecosystem on which any plant can flourish, despite him being nocturnal and mostly sticking to shady areas. The roses on his back react violently towards aggressors, emitting burst of toxins that can cause burning rashes and short-term monoplegia. His head is filled with poisonous goo that he regurgitates to fend off predators, but also to attract mates.
