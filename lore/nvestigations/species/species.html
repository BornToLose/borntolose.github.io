						Over time, their aroma has mutated into a light-bending veil that makes them virtually impervious to harm. The more of them gather, the more their veils fill with glowing colors and flaring sparks. Sadly, their taste is so delicious that the vast majority of their predators have completely adapted to it, and their regenerative abilities prove useless as they always get devoured to the very last crumb.

						Although their morphology is fit for living in the depths of dark-lit woods, their limited combat abilities caused members of this species to gradually move closer to cities. Thanks to their highly-developed mental capacities and fast typing speed, they prove to be surprisingly skilled technicians. However, they tend to lack organizational skills, meaning they will often lose track of their previous work.<br><br>

It is very proud of its appearance, constantly showing off by scattering around flower petals and crystal pebbles; if left ignored, it may get spiteful in return. It only seeks to mate with other females.

						They march in packs composed of about a dozen individuals, marking the land as their own. Each one wears an armor made of cooling lava encrusted with dark blue gems, and is well-versed in the art of close-ranged combat, mental focus, and ki manipulation. The younger ones of the pack may appear affectionate, but it is only a trick to spread the pestilence they carry.

						They let themselves be freely carried by the wind, leaving a trail of sweet aroma behind them. At the mercy of wind currents, they look as if they are dancing through the sky. When they reach a host fit for pollination, they psychically latch onto it and start leeching its life force away; when the host if sufficiently drained, it can be made to produce new seeds, perpetuating the cycle.

						Once the seed has absorbed enough nutrients, it grows inside its membrane, stretching the latter before it hardens into a diamond-like chrysalis. Completely immobile, it creates bursts of winds with its mind to move around at high speeds, but cannot see where it's going; because it spends its time psychically polishing its shell, its edges are so sharp that anything it collides with is instantly sliced in half.

Its body is then able expurgate it at will, but it must ingurgitate it again afterwards. If one is seen dancing, it must be avoided at all costs; it is likely trying to lure a prey to latch onto with its hidden teeth, in order to replace the mineral nutrients it lost.

It likes to draw attention by pretending to be hurt, but the smell of its tears is so strong that it'll make anyone pass out; this earned it the nickname of "curse-flavored cream", even though it means no harm. It is customary to adorn it with a paper umbrella to make it more recognizable.

						When the cream that makes up its body goes bad, moldy brown hair forms all over it. Said hair is highly poisonous to the touch, and the Pokémon itself only survives thanks to his body's extreme alcohol level. It has learned to produce icy mist to move things around, and can even use this to claw at people it wants to keep away. Meanwhile, it is slowly purging itself, leaving behind toxin-full droppings encased in ice.

When it flies high up, the sudden temperature shift it produces can cause mild thunderstorms. While its feathers are a renowned luxury treat, inexperienced tasters should never have more than a few nibbles, as their sheer purity may result in an instant brain arrest.

According to myths, it is a patron of silent nights, who wields a blade made of lightning and a whip made of wood to strike down the nightmares and creatures that lurk in the dark until morning. Children are often taught not to fear stormy nights, as they are a sign that it is standing guard to protect them in their sleep.

Its body produces a sticky substance on which rocks, fiber, and all kinds of materials get stuck, creating an intimidating and resilient shell. As a result, what it truly looks like underneath is unknown.
