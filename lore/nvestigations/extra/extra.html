					I need to practice my drawing skills, so I made a sketch of my sister Nia! I only learned recently that I had a sister, but we've been getting along great. We have a lot in common; she also believes in building a world where humans and Pok√©mon live in harmony, and while she doesn't think the solution is to free the latter from their Trainers, we still pursue the same goal in the end.<br>
					Having someone close to share things with is really great. I did have "sisters" back at the castle, but they were more like caretakers... This is different, I feel. I never knew I'd appreciate so much to meet a long-lost sibling, but it almost makes me hope she's not the only one out there.
