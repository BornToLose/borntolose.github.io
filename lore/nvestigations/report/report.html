						<b>Day 3, Hour 12</b><br> 
						The Host went back to Nacrene City; I took advantage of this to visit the city's library while keeping an eye on them. I think the information I found might be the missing link between all of these clues, but I am still unclear on how exactly "Mars" relates to it all. Are they a member of this organization, or they taking a stand against them? <br>
						The goals of said organization might very well be a path towards the better world I dream of. But they might also have a very different objective in mind. Either way, I don't believe "Mars" would be willing to trust me at this point. <br>
						Whatever the case, there are dangerous forces at play here. Forces I'd rather not make <b><i>him</i></b> aware of. But I can't hold off information from him forever if I want to protect my friends...

							This unique specimen appears to once have been an incredibly powerful fighter. He fights viciously, evading attacks by disappearing completely before knocking his opponent into the ground at full force. Whenever he loses a fight, a ghastly aura glows around him, a manifestation of the fiery grudge he holds. He seems particularly interested in the various parasitic lifeforms currently found around Unova.

						In the very rare case where this species survives until maturation, it develops an iron-clad shell that lets it endure even the harshest of conditions. It is known to be awfully loud, producing horrible screeching noises. This specific individual is however unusually quiet, but the sound waves it produces wreck everything in their path; its appearance suggests that it might actually belong to an unknown regional sub-species.

						I have pursued my investigation of the events you have informed me about.
