						<b>Day 3, Hour 12</b><br> 
						The Host went back to Nacrene City; I took advantage of this to visit the city's library while keeping an eye on them. I think the information I found might be the missing link between all of these clues, but I am still unclear on how exactly "Mars" relates to it all. Are they a member of this organization, or they taking a stand against them? <br>
						The goals of said organization might very well be a path towards the better world I dream of. But they might also have a very different objective in mind. Either way, I don't believe "Mars" would be willing to trust me at this point. <br>
						Whatever the case, there are dangerous forces at play here. Forces I'd rather not make <b><i>him</i></b> aware of. But I can't hold off information from him forever if I want to protect my friends...

						They started referring to themself as a "nurse"; I figured this meant they must've had a high-level education, so with what I've figured so far of their identity, I attempted to pursue that lead, looking into student records of schools primarily across both Unova and Sinnoh.

It is known to be awfully loud, producing horrible screeching noises. This specific individual is however unusually quiet, but the sound waves it produces wreck everything in their path; its appearance suggests that it might actually belong to an unknown regional sub-species.

						Something is not adding up. I know Father enough to understand that he plans to double-cross Alder as soon as he gets the chance.

							He is a neighbour of "Mars". I initially believed they were friends, as the two were hanging together when I introduced myself to them, but it he has since openly revealed himself as having joined Team Plasma. He turned against them when while they were confronting a pair of Plasma members inside Wellspring Cave, and they ended up fighting. This might just be a misinterpretation on my part, but they both looked visibly distressed afterwards.<br>						
							Notably, while he did not appear interested when I disclosed my ideals of freedom and harmony between Pokémon and humans, he appeared much more receptive to Alder's advice regarding ways of becoming a stronger Trainer. I know Team Plasma's current plans likely have nothing to do with my own original vision for it, but this seems to confirm its members, at least in part, are well aware of this.
