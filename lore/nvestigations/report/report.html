							This unique specimen appears to once have been an incredibly powerful fighter. He fights viciously, evading attacks by disappearing completely before knocking his opponent into the ground at full force. Whenever he loses a fight, a ghastly aura glows around him, a manifestation of the fiery grudge he holds. He seems particularly interested in the various parasitic lifeforms currently found around Unova.

							Reaching his final form unleashed his full fighting potential, as he now delivers hits so fast and powerful that they defy measurement. His body has become cold as ice, and the hateful souls inside him can be heard as they come out to protect him or make him vanish into the ground; it is unknown where he goes when the latter happens. He appears to seek a weapon that would let him increase his power even further.

						In the very rare case where this species survives until maturation, it develops an iron-clad shell that lets it endure even the harshest of conditions. It is known to be awfully loud, producing horrible screeching noises. This specific individual is however unusually quiet, but the sound waves it produces wreck everything in their path; its appearance suggests that it might actually belong to an unknown regional sub-species.
