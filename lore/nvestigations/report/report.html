						<b>Day 3, Hour 12</b><br> 
						The Host went back to Nacrene City; I took advantage of this to visit the city's library while keeping an eye on them. I think the information I found might be the missing link between all of these clues, but I am still unclear on how exactly "Mars" relates to it all. Are they a member of this organization, or they taking a stand against them? <br>
						The goals of said organization might very well be a path towards the better world I dream of. But they might also have a very different objective in mind. Either way, I don't believe "Mars" would be willing to trust me at this point. <br>
						Whatever the case, there are dangerous forces at play here. Forces I'd rather not make <b><i>him</i></b> aware of. But I can't hold off information from him forever if I want to protect my friends...

						I've been trying to figure out more about the identity of "Mars" in order to further my research, but the lack of certitude is certainly making this complicated.<br>
						They started referring to themself as a "nurse"; I figured this meant they must've had a high-level education, so with what I've figured so far of their identity, I attempted to pursue that lead, looking into student records of schools primarily across both Unova and Sinnoh.

He fights viciously, evading attacks by disappearing completely before knocking his opponent into the ground at full force. Whenever he loses a fight, a ghastly aura glows around him, a manifestation of the fiery grudge he holds.

						In the very rare case where this species survives until maturation, it develops an iron-clad shell that lets it endure even the harshest of conditions. It is known to be awfully loud, producing horrible screeching noises. This specific individual is however unusually quiet, but the sound waves it produces wreck everything in their path; its appearance suggests that it might actually belong to an unknown regional sub-species.
